# This is a weather application completely build with javascript Es2015, Html and CSS. I also made use of a third party weather API inorder to fetch some data necessary for it to function properly.

It displays the current weather for you depending on your location. Make sure you enable location access on your browser because if it is blocked then it can know which location you are and won't be able to show you the weather for your location at that current time.

Note: After donwloading the repository make sure you run the files in a php server or localhost inorder for it to function.

Thank you.
